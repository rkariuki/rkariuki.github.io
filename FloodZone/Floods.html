While where there is a 1 in 4 chance of flooding during a 30-year period at the coastal regions. With .2 pct annual chance floodhazard are visible in red close to rivers and streams. Periodic flooding of lands adjacent to non-tidal rivers or streams (areas known as a floodplain) is a natural and inevitable occurrence and can be expected to take place within regular recurrence intervals. The recurrence interval of a flood is defined as the average time, in years,expected between a flood event of a particular magnitude and anequal or larger flooding.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">In the city of Jacksonville,Data would show that the city is prone to a chance of flood hazard especially people who are nearbystreams or rivers like Newriver. From the map onecould analyze that there is anintersect of housing andfacilities indicted in thelegend. It shows that a lothave been developed north of Jacksonville where there is reoccurring floods the waterways.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion and Evacuation preparedness.</h1><br>
    <p>From the map which one can see a clear indication of which parts the community needs to focus on during flood crisis, evacuations routes were made. The routes evade fromf lood zones and are multidirectional starting the origin which would be the north. The evacuation does cover helping critical facilities that are marked on the map.</p>
    <p>By clicking Floods map button will help visualize the map and one is able to remove or add the layers to get a better understanding. Credit goes to Esri and for data collection goes to Onslow County GIS department.</p>
