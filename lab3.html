  <h1> Parks and Heritage Trees in the Portland Area</h1>
  <p> Data attained from ArcGIS REST Services Directory, I was to display parks and in a polygon basis and Heritage trees as a marker to give distinction. Below talks more about Heritage trees.</p>
  <p1>What does it take for a tree to be recognized as an Oregon Heritage Tree?</p2><br><p3> Oregon Travel Experience researches each tree nomination with a dedicated group of volunteers. Certain criteria such as accessibility to the public, tree health and historic significance all play a role in whether or not a tree or grove qualifies.</p3>
<p4>Honored groves, single trees or groups of trees have something in common with one another no matter what the species – they are trees that tell a story; trees that confound and astound; trees that educate both Oregonians and visitors about significant people or events from the past; trees that have survived natural disasters or stand as silent sentries to the passage of time.</p4> <p5>And that’s only a small part of what makes an Oregon Heritage Tree compelling.</p5>
